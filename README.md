## 📖 Overview  
This project tackles the **unique challenges of Indian traffic simulations** by enabling realistic digital twin creation of roads and junctions. Using **MATLAB**, **Simulink**, **RoadRunner**, and **Three.js**, the workflow integrates potholes, barricades, and hyper-local driving behaviors into a 3D simulation pipeline.  

The solution bridges **2D MATLAB driving scenarios** with **3D interactive web visualizations**, empowering traffic agencies to model congestion, test safety responses, and plan infrastructure faster.

## ✨ Key Features  
- **Dynamic Obstacle Modeling**: Add potholes, barricades, and lane closures directly into scenarios.  
- **Realistic Driving Behavior**: Adaptive speed control with obstacle + curvature awareness.  
- **MATLAB + Three.js Integration**: Export simulation data as JSON and visualize it in 3D.  
- **Telemetry Dashboard**: Live updates for speed, distance, and path reasons.  
- **Customizable Templates**: Extend to any junction or city road network.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **MATLAB & Simulink** – Scenario design and traffic simulation  
- **Automated Driving Toolbox** – Vehicle and road behavior modeling  
- **Three.js** – 3D visualization in the browser  
- **Generative Extensions (optional)** – Automate asset creation and scene variations  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start  
1. Run MATLAB script to generate simulation data (`.mat` and JSON).  
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to see the **3D traffic simulation**.  
3. Add your logo and video in the `assets/` folder for customization.

## 📌 Future Scope  
- Generative AI for road asset placement.  
- Automated import of Indian road data from OpenStreetMap.  
- Multi-agent driver behavior training.
